#Personal Capital Net Cash#

This script is designed to add a "Net Cash" item to the Accounts sidebar of [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com).

The script will run on page load once all account data has been set. The script does not currently listen to the single-page-application navigation events to update itself, nor will it update itself when the account totals are updated. If the "Net Cash" node disappears or is out of date, refresh the page.

NB: As with any script designed for a third party site, this script could break at any time because of an update to Personal Capital's interface.
